# Project Nebula — Redacted Case Study
Public, sanitized documentation of an authorized assessment of a subscription/credits platform. Focus: API surface signals, egress posture, and client verification mapping. No secrets or working exploits.


- **Highlights:** Host header behavior (recon‑only), SSTI indicators, strict GraphQL, client OpenSSL verification gate
- **Docs:** see `/docs`
- **Scripts:** minimal SAFE PoCs under `/scripts` (lab endpoints only)
